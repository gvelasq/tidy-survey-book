Why read this book It is very important… Structure of the book Chapters ?? introduces a new topic, and … Software information and conventions I used the knitr package (Xie 2015) and the bookdown package (Xie 2022) to compile my book. My R session information is shown below: xfun::session_info() ## R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) ## Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit) ## Running under: macOS Big Sur 10.16 ## ## Locale: en_US.UTF-8 / en_US.UTF-8 / en_US.UTF-8 / C / en_US.UTF-8 / en_US.UTF-8 ## ## Package version: ## base64enc_0.1.3 bookdown_0.26 bslib_0.3.1 ## cli_3.3.0 compiler_4.1.2 digest_0.6.29 ## evaluate_0.15 fastmap_1.1.0 fs_1.5.2 ## glue_1.6.2 graphics_4.1.2 grDevices_4.1.2 ## highr_0.9 htmltools_0.5.2 jquerylib_0.1.4 ## jsonlite_1.8.0 knitr_1.39 magrittr_2.0.3 ## methods_4.1.2 R6_2.5.1 rappdirs_0.3.3 ## rlang_1.0.2 rmarkdown_2.14 rstudioapi_0.13 ## sass_0.4.1 stats_4.1.2 stringi_1.7.6 ## stringr_1.4.0 tinytex_0.39 tools_4.1.2 ## utils_4.1.2 xfun_0.31 yaml_2.3.5 Package names are in bold text (e.g., rmarkdown), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., bookdown::render_book()). Acknowledgments A lot of people helped me when I was writing the book.

R gives us the flexibility to load datasets regardless of their file extension. We will cover the file types we are most likely to encounter in survey analysis: delimiter-separated text files, Excel files, .dta files from Stata, and .sas files from SAS. 3.1.1 Best practices for loading data into R 3.1.2 Loading delimiter-separated files into R Delimiter-separated files use specific characters to separate values. For example, comma-separated values (CSV) files are separated by commas. These file types are widely used and we can use many applications to read and write them. We can read delimiter-separated files using the tidyverse package {readr}. The {readr} package supports the following files with these read_*() functions: read_csv(): Comma-separated values (CSV) files read_tsv(): Tab-separated values (TSV) files read_delim(): Delimiter-separated files (CSV and TSV are important special cases) read_fwf(): Fixed-width files read_table(): Whitespace-separated files read_log(): Web log files 3.1.3 Loading Stata .dta files into R Stata is a popular statistical software package for data manipulation, visualization, statistics, and automated reporting. Stata stores its data using the proprietary .dta format, a file type that can contain labels for the data’s variables and values. The {haven} package imports a variety of proprietary data formats, including Stata’s .dta files, SAS’s .sas files, and SPSS’s .sav files. Once imported, we can analyze the resulting tibbles in R. haven::read_dta(&quot;https://www.stata-press.com/data/r17/smho.dta&quot;) ## # A tibble: 120 × 10 ## id hosptype exptotal beds seencnt eoycnt ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 14 1 [Psychiatric] 18 138 3083 308 ## 2 19 1 [Psychiatric] 6 72 1557 15 ## 3 30 1 [Psychiatric] 10 79 1822 191 ## 4 32 1 [Psychiatric] 4 15 1201 0 ## 5 44 1 [Psychiatric] 2 31 1346 0 ## 6 47 1 [Psychiatric] 10 139 1739 126 ## 7 52 1 [Psychiatric] 15 169 2614 0 ## 8 54 1 [Psychiatric] 15 96 1137 82 ## 9 58 1 [Psychiatric] 10 83 1783 164 ## 10 62 1 [Psychiatric] 10 178 1956 305 ## # … with 110 more rows, and 4 more variables: ## # findirct &lt;dbl&gt;, wt &lt;dbl&gt;, stratum &lt;dbl&gt;, N_h &lt;dbl&gt; 3.1.4 Loading SAS .sas files into R Similar to the 3.2 Working with labelled data We can use the haven::labelled() function to import labelled vectors into R. The goal is to create an intermediate object and then convert it into a regular R data frame to use in our analysis. 3.3 Missing data For Stata and SAS, {haven} provides tagged missing values. This adds a single character label to R’s regular NA.
